To point a copied local repository to the new GitHub repository as its remote, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to your local repository**:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/copied-repo
   ```

2. **Remove the existing remote (if any)**:

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

   If there is a remote (e.g., `origin`), remove it:

   ```bash
   git remote remove origin
   ```

3. **Add the new GitHub repository as a remote**:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin <new-repo-url>
   ```

4. **Verify the new remote**:

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

   You should see something like:

   ```
   origin  https://github.com/your-username/new-repo-name.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/your-username/new-repo-name.git (push)
   ```

5. **Push the local repository to GitHub**: The `-u` flag sets this branch to track the remote branch.

   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   Replace `main` with the branch name you're working on, if it's not `main`.
